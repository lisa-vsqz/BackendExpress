## Overview

This project is a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** web application built using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architectural pattern. It provides a simple interface to manage resources (e.g., users, products, or tasks) and interact with a database. 

Users can create new records, view existing records, update them, and delete them, all via an intuitive web interface. The project is designed with separation of concerns in mind, where:
- **Models** manage data and database operations.
- **Views** handle the presentation of the data.
- **Controllers** manage user input and interact with models and views.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations
- **Responsive** user interface using **Bootstrap**
- **Database integration** to store and manage data
- **Validation** for input fields to ensure data integrity
- **Search functionality** to easily find records
- **Sorting** and **pagination** for better data navigation
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **RESTful API** for interacting with the system programmatically

## Technologies

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

## Architecture

The project follows the **MVC** architecture, which ensures a clean separation of concerns between the application's data, user interface, and control logic.

- **Model**: Represents the data and the business logic. Interacts with the database using Entity Framework Core.
- **View**: Handles the presentation layer and displays data from the model to the user.
- **Controller**: Manages user input and passes data between the view and the model.
